A series of simplified global climate model, built in training

Starting October 2019, as part of my ongoing professional development, I have taken a set of free online courses offered by The University of Chicago through coursera.org.  As part of these lectures, a number of global climate models, varying in complexity, are presented. I have found that to best learn complex physical systems, writing their processes numerically helps immensely; this repo holds the model code I write as I took the course.

Below I've kept a log of the lectures and the associated code, with some additional notes.

## Global Warming I: The Science and Modeling of Climate Change
### Lesson 3: 
- Naked earth (bare-rock) model
- Greenhouse effect

## Global Warming II: Create Your Own Models in Python
### Lesson 1: 
- (Transient) naked earth (bare-rock) model
